                    Graduated from Ryerson with a Bachelor of Commerce. Getting
                    ready to jump start my career as a new Dev! Started with
                    taking a Full Stack Development course at UTM focusing on
                    the MERN (Mongo, React, Express, Node.js) stack. 6 months

                    Started off in life sciences and not so quickly realized it
                    wasn't for me. Began to study coding on my own and after
                    watching countless youtube videos and doing a lot of
                    tutorials, I realized this is what I want to be doing. Have
                    now completed a 6 month bootcamp course and ready to start
                    my career in web development.
