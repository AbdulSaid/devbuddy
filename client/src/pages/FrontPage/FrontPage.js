          <p className="about-font">
            Web developers are at the forefront of the Internet age. The
            websites we browse, the gifts we order and the news we peruse online
            are all made possible by the web developers who design, build and
            implement Internet websites. They are heavily involved in website
            creation, from helping design aesthetic properties such as layout
            and color, to technical considerations such as how to design a
            website to handle a given amount of Internet traffic.

          <p className="about-font">
            In terms of job availability, the timing really could not be better
            for web developers. there are a plethora of jobs and not enough
            people with the right skills for hire. 61% of executives say they
            face recruitment challenges when it comes to highly skilled and
            technical positions. as the gap between qualified workers and
            unfilled jobs continues to grow, it is expected that the gap will
            grow even greater for those looking for web developers. as any
            business 101 class will teach you, high demand and low supply can
            certainly lead to price increases. in this case, price equals web
            developersâ€™ salaries!
